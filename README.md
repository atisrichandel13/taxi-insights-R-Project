# taxi-insights-R-Project
A high-performance **R microservice** capable of performing statistical aggregation and linear modeling on **3 Million+ records** in milliseconds.  This project demonstrates how to bridge the gap between **Data Science** (R/Linear Models) and **Data Engineering** (DuckDB/Parquet) by building a containerized API that runs efficiently on limited RAM.
